In order to help NetEase Cloud Music (NCM) enhance user experience and ultimately improve its user engagement, we aim to differentiate inactive users from active users and build a customized recommender system. In this report we provide a summary of our findings from analysis of the NCM business case and the accompanying data set. The code used to perform the analysis and develop recommender systems can be found in [my Github](https://github.com/jing042323/Case-Study/tree/main/NCM).

This report is structured around 4 main sections:  
**1. Introduction and Business Goals**  
- About NCM  
- The Data   
- Our goals

**2. User Characteristics and Engagement**  
A detailed analysis of the NCM dataset to produce insight and understanding regarding user characteristics and preferences.  
- Usage Scenarios  
- User Activity Intensity  
- User Demographics: location, gender and age  
- User Behavior and Preferences: tenure, impression and content  

**3. User Activity Prediction Model** 
Models to predict user activity based on users' early actions. 
- Logistic Regression  
- SVM  
- Random Forest  
- Neural Networks  

**4. Recommender System**  
- A review of recommender system best practice
- Recommender systems for NCM and their relative merits  

**5. Business Implications**  
- Recommendations to NCM

Broadly speaking, recommender systems are algorithms used to suggest personalised, relevant content to users based on some underlying knowledge of both the item and the individual. With the growth of online platforms, a key product differentiator is the ability of an effective recommender system to provide the most engaging and valuable experience. In particular, the system must overcome the limitation of the relatively small real estate a screen provides to deliver targeted content of interest to a specific individual. There are several methods of delivering this capability that can be broadly categorised as follows:
- **Content-based filtering** – Items are assigned metadata to reflect its characteristics. The algorithm then recommends items to a user that are similar to those they have previously selected.  
- **Collaborative filtering** – This approach uses a matrix of item preferences across the user base. By analyzing similarities between users or items, the algorithm predicts what users might be interested in and make recommendations to them. There are user-based, item-based and model-based collaborative filtering.
- **Contextual filtering** – Recommend items that match known information about the users’ current circumstances or environment, e.g., location, events or even the time of the day.
- **Social and demographic filtering** – Recommend items that are liked by demographically similar users or people who have been tagged as 'friends'.

In the following sections we explore how 3 of the world's largest content platform recommendation systems (YouTube, Netflix and Spotify) approach the challenges of developing an effective system and use this as a basis for our subsequent analysis.
