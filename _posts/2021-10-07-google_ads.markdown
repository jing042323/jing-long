In this project, we had a firsthand experience of 'running' a business. We first design and launch our own website by Weebly, and use tag manager to monitor the site via Google Analytics. Then, we use Google Paid/Keyword Advertising with a budget of £20 to bring visitors to our site. Our goal is to measure the effectiveness of our advertising plan and adjust our decision making through analysing the real data we collect over a few weeks.

# <span style="border-bottom:2px solid SeaGreen;color:SeaGreen">1. Introduction</span>  

## <span style="color:SeaGreen"> 1.1 Business Context </span>  

We are a new start-up travel consultancy company, set up by four travelling enthusiasts who like traveling around the globe exploring new places and experience. We are interested to share our great experience with others, hence offering this service to provide customized tour consulting service to customer in curating the personalized tour itinerary, accommodations, logistic planning based on our experience and network across different continents. With the personalized plan offered, customer could save time in doing the tour planning work, grab their luggage, and enjoy the travelling.  

We have developed a website [TOURSCURATOR4U](http://tourscurator4u.weebly.com/) to showcase our service and as one of the means to spread our business. Our website is structured with a home page and three sub-pages, which reflects our three main offerings:
- City/urban tour  
- Cultural tour  
- Adventurous tour  

At the early launch of our website, we spread the news informing close circle of contacts to visit the website and promote our services. However, visits to the website were limited and new users to the website would depend directly on internal marketing efforts. In order to acquire more traffic to our website as well as to use our website to establish potential customer base (users leaving their contact for our product offering) for a broader international market, we plan to run a new campaign using digital marketing tool like Google Ads.  

## <span style="color:SeaGreen"> 1.2 Google Ads Campaign Objectives </span>  

Google is an indisputable champion of the world’s search engine market. The latest research indicates that Google has acquired 92.41% of the world’s market share (StatCounter, 2021). Google is where people search for what to do, where to go and what to buy. After comparing with other types of advertising, and due to our limited budget (£20 maximum), we decide to use Google Ads (Search Network) for our official website. Our ads have the chance to appear on Google at the moment when someone is looking for products or services like ours. A well-timed advertisement can turn visitors into valuable customers.  

In our last round of word-of-mouth campaign, we have 80 visitors in total for 2 weeks. And based on information provided by Google Ads, it estimates that we can have at least 240 clicks for one month which is equivalent to about 60 clicks per week. Considering this information and our business objectives, we are ambitious and expect to double the number of visitors in our last round of campaign. Therefore, our primary target is to acquire **80** new visitors within **1** week(for example, 6 days) by running Google Ads. Since our previous campaign among close circle of contacts were focusing on the four countries of Malaysia, Singapore, Ireland and United Kingdom, we plan to have the Google Ad published to these 4 countries as target market. 

In addition, a typical customer’s path to purchase has 3 major steps: Awareness, Evaluation, Decision (Srinivasan, 2016). Thus, for our campaign to be effective, it is important that our marketing effort addresses the customer’s needs at each step of her decision-making process, and more importantly, nudges her positively towards making a purchase. Hence, our Ads campaign aims to let more people know and remember us, indicate our main service, and attract people to click our Ads.

</p>

In summary, there are 3 steps we want our customers to accomplish in this Ads campaign:
- Create awareness, i.e., visit & navigate our website  
-	Generate interest & desire, i.e., like our content  
- Catch Attention, i.e., join us by providing their contact information

# <span style="border-bottom:2px solid SeaGreen;color:SeaGreen">2. Ads Preparation</span> 

Before the design of our ads, let's look at some important information on how Google Ads works, especially the format of ads and how to win an advertisement position.  

First, there are different ways to show ads on Google’s advertising networks, including (i) **Google Search Network** - advertising in the search results and partner websites; (ii) **Google Display Network** - visual advertisement by banners on different websites across the web. Considering the aims of this project and our spending budget, we will use **Google Search Network** to display our ads. Furthermore, Google uses **broad match** as the default match type in Google Ads. In this way, if someone searches something identical or similar to our selected keywords on Google, our ads will have the chance to appear over or next to the regular (i.e. organic) results.  

Second, once our ads are designed and launched, whether they can be shown or not depends on **Ad Rank** which measures the ranking of our ads on the list of all advertisers who are competing for a particular keyword. Ad Rank is determined by 3 parameters including bid price, quality score and format impact. Bid price plays a key role in the ranking of our ads and is decided through our bidding strategy, while quality score is estimated by Google after evaluating the expected number of clicks(CTR), relevance and landing page quality of our ads. Format impact is not relevant in our case as it is more important in Google Display Network. So our final Ad Rank formula is **Ad Rank = Bid * Quality Score**.  

Based on the above information, aiming to get a higher Ad Rank for our ads, we will start our ads by the following steps: 
- gain insight on tourism advertising by competitor analysis;  
- design our ads;  
- decide our bidding strategy and keywords;  
- publish our final ads on Google.  

## <span style="color:SeaGreen"> 2.1 Competitor Analysis </span>  

As a new entrant, we lack information about the tourism industry. And whether our ads can be shown or not is closely related to the strategies of our competitors. By spying on our competitors, we can quickly learn about how competitive this industry is and what ads they have, and thus better make our advertising plan. The focus of our competitor analysis will be in two part, i.e., advertisement design and bidding strategy.

- ### Advertisement Design  

We searched several keywords relating to our business, such as tour planner and travel agency, to see who will be competing with us in Google Ads. We tried the same keyword search in four target countries of our ads, including Singapore, Malaysia, the UK and Ireland.  

According to our search results, we find that the advertisement contents from our potential competitors are quite similar in different countries. Most advertisements consist of a brief and clear introduction of the key products followed by an invitation to visiting the websites. In addition, words like 'free' and 'best' are widely used to attract and motivate visitors.  

However, there are still some differences among our target countries and these differences may bring us some ideas on how to improve our ad design and set our bidding strategy in different competition environment. Firstly, when searching 'tour planner' in Google, most of the results are shown in 'trip planner' or 'travel planner' instead in the UK, which means 'trip' and 'travel' are perhaps more in line with English language habits. (The figure below shows an example of our search results: ‘tour planner’ and ‘travel agency’ searches in Google UK.) Therefore we need to pay attention to the use of words in our ad design, making it more acceptable to our target customers. Secondly, the number of ads shown is different in our target countries. For example, we get more ads displayed in Google UK than in Google Singapore when searching the same keywords. It could be caused by different advertising policies and intensity of competition in these countries.

- ### Bidding Strategy  

Whether our ads can be shown successfully depends not only on our own bid price but also highly depends on the bidding strategies of our competitors. Understanding competitors’ actions plays a key role in the process of developing our own bidding strategy. There are some tools online to spy on our competitors, such as Auction Insights, SimilarWeb, Ahrefs, SEMRush, etc. (OMG, 2021). Most of these tools need registration and charge for service. Due to our limited budget, we chose [SEMRush](https://www.semrush.com/) which specializes in competitor data and provides free trials.  

We checked CPC, keyword difficulty, volume and competitive density of a group of keywords in different countries. Values of these indexes show us how our potential competitors compete in the current advertising market and how hard for us to join and win the competition.  

Taking keyword 'Travel Planning' as an example, the following table presents values of the indexes we mentioned above and the figure below is the screenshots of keyword overview in the UK, Singapore, Malaysia and Ireland.  

|     Country      |     CPC($)    |     Keyword Difficulty    |     Volume    |     Competitive Density    |
|------------------|---------------|---------------------------|---------------|----------------------------|
|     The   UK     |     1.83      |     80%                   |     24000     |     0.37                   |
|     Singapore    |     0.51      |     75%                   |     140       |     0.25                   |
|     Malaysia     |     0.45      |     66%                   |     170       |     0.06                   |
|     Ireland      |     1.03      |     /                     |     10        |     0.09                   |

<p align="center">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Google_Ads/competitor2.png" height="440" width="600" />  
</p>

We can see that situation varies in our target countries. The UK market faces the most intensive competition with the highest CPC and competitive density. Our competitors in the UK market pays on average $1.83 for one click on their ads. But the UK is also the largest market among the four countries as it has the biggest volume, which means there are a much greater number of visitors in the UK search for 'Travel planning'.  

A brief summary of average CPC of different keywords in our four target countries is shown below:  

|     Keyword                       |     Average CPC($)    |     Average CPC(£)    |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
|     Travel   planning             |     0.96              |     0.69              |
|     Travel   itinerary planner    |     0.74              |     0.53              |
|     Travel   tips                 |     0.71              |     0.51              |
|     Travel   agency               |     1.62              |     1.17              |
|     Plan   your trip              |     1.29              |     0.93              |
|     Travel   consulting           |     1.07              |     0.77              |
|     City   tour                   |     0.48              |     0.35              |
|     Culture   tour                |     1.05              |     0.76              |  

Above all, it will be more efficient if we could differentiate our advertisement design and bidding strategy in different countries. However, due to the limited spending budget and running period of our ads, this time we will simplify the case by only launching the identical advertisement and trying the same bidding strategy in all our target countries.
