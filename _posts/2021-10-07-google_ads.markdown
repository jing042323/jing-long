In this project, we had a firsthand experience of 'running' a business. We first design and launch our own website by Weebly, and use tag manager to monitor the site via Google Analytics. Then, we use Google Paid/Keyword Advertising with a budget of £20 to bring visitors to our site. Our goal is to measure the effectiveness of our advertising plan and adjust our decision making through analysing the real data we collect over a few weeks.

## <span style="color:SeaGreen"> 1.1 Business Context </span>  

We are a new start-up travel consultancy company, set up by four travelling enthusiasts who like traveling around the globe exploring new places and experience. We are interested to share our great experience with others, hence offering this service to provide customized tour consulting service to customer in curating the personalized tour itinerary, accommodations, logistic planning based on our experience and network across different continents. With the personalized plan offered, customer could save time in doing the tour planning work, grab their luggage, and enjoy the travelling.  

We have developed a website [TOURSCURATOR4U](http://tourscurator4u.weebly.com/) to showcase our service and as one of the means to spread our business. Our website is structured with a home page and three sub-pages, which reflects our three main offerings:
- City/urban tour  
- Cultural tour  
- Adventurous tour  

At the early launch of our website, we spread the news informing close circle of contacts to visit the website and promote our services. However, visits to the website were limited and new users to the website would depend directly on internal marketing efforts. In order to acquire more traffic to our website as well as to use our website to establish potential customer base (users leaving their contact for our product offering) for a broader international market, we plan to run a new campaign using digital marketing tool like Google Ads.  

## <span style="color:SeaGreen"> 1.2 Google Ads Campaign Objectives </span>  

Google is an indisputable champion of the world’s search engine market. The latest research indicates that Google has acquired 92.41% of the world’s market share (StatCounter, 2021). Google is where people search for what to do, where to go and what to buy. After comparing with other types of advertising, and due to our limited budget (£20 maximum), we decide to use Google Ads (Search Network) for our official website. Our ads have the chance to appear on Google at the moment when someone is looking for products or services like ours. A well-timed advertisement can turn visitors into valuable customers.  

In our last round of word-of-mouth campaign, we have 80 visitors in total for 2 weeks. And based on information provided by Google Ads, it estimates that we can have at least 240 clicks for one month which is equivalent to about 60 clicks per week. Considering this information and our business objectives, we are ambitious and expect to double the number of visitors in our last round of campaign. Therefore, our primary target is to acquire **80** new visitors within **1** week(for example, 6 days) by running Google Ads.  

In addition, a typical customer’s path to purchase has 3 major steps: Awareness, Evaluation, Decision (Srinivasan, 2016). Thus, for our campaign to be effective, it is important that our marketing effort addresses the customer’s needs at each step of her decision-making process, and more importantly, nudges her positively towards making a purchase. Hence, our Ads campaign aims to let more people know and remember us, indicate our main service, and attract people to click our Ads.  

In summary, there are 3 steps we want our customers to accomplish in this Ads campaign:
