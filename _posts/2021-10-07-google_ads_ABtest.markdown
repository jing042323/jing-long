In this project, we had a very exciting firsthand experience of 'running' a business. We first design and launch our own website by Weebly, and use tag manager to monitor the site via Google Analytics. To find out a more effective plan for our website design, we conduct an A/B test through analysing the real data we collect over a few weeks.

We are a new start-up travel consultancy company, set up by four travelling enthusiasts who like traveling around the globe exploring new places and experience. We are interested to share our great experience with others, hence offering this service to provide customized tour consulting service to customer in curating the personalized tour itinerary, accommodations, logistic planning based on our experience and network across different continents. With the personalized plan offered, customer could save time in doing the tour planning work, grab their luggage, and enjoy the travelling.

We have developed a website (http://tourscurator4u.weebly.com/) to showcase our service and as one of the means to spread our business. Our website is structured with a home page, and three sub-pages, which reflects our main three offerings: 
- City/Urban tour
- Cultural tour
- Adventurous tour

In order to build and expand our customer base, we plan to use our website to attract potential customers. We have created a *‘JOIN US!’* button in our website, which enables our website visitors to become our member. We would like to use this *‘JOIN US!’* button to collect more customer information, such as contact information, demographic information, interests, etc, to better segmentize our customer, provide customized service, as well as providing targeted engagement like travelling tips, blogs. In addition, for every click of *‘JOIN US!’* button, it offers opportunity for us to respond and offer follow-up of customized and personalized tour advices, hence turning in potential revenue.  

For click of button in every session by visitor, we will be able to follow-up with the visitor. Say, a visitor views our website, interested to get our service, and clicks the *‘JOIN US!’* button on day 1. We will respond accordingly. If the same visitor comes back a week later and have another idea in mind to explore another tour, he/she can click ‘JOIN US!’ button again, for a new service offering for the new tour. Similarly, we will respond to the new request received.
