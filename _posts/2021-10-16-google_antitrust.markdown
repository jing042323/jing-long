Recently Google has been subjected to multiple antitrust cases in many countries. Google is alleged to be abusing its monopoly and network power. In this report, a case study on Google, focusing on the mobile access segment, has been carried out. Analysis on its practices on mobile operating system, mobile apps, network effect and a few learning from other antitrust cases have revealed the following:  

**i.	Google’s dominance in mobile operating system market:**  
Android represents the largest market share of worldwide mobile operating system market. Google abuses its market power and uses various strategies to maintain this dominance, including (1) accessing real-time and vast amount of user data; (2) using contractual restrictions to favor its own applications; (3) acquisition of other tech companies to expand its market share.  

**ii.	Dominance of Android’s default applications**  
Some default applications from Google in Android are also dominate in their markets, especially Google Search and Chrome. Google required Android handset and tablet manufacturers to pre-install the Google Search and Chrome as a condition for allowing them to offer access to its Play app store:  
- As for Google Search, it represents the largest market share in search market and behaves monopolistically, including (1) data and content misappropriation; (2) giving priority to its own products and services; (3) increasing revenue by raising market access prices.  
- As for Chrome, it also occupies the largest market in both mobile and desktop web browser market and behaves monopolistically, including (1) giving priority to Google’s products and services; (2) strengthening Google and hurting its competitors by setting standard unilaterally.  
- Google made payments to large manufacturers and mobile network operators that agreed to exclusively pre-install the Google Search app on their devices.   

**iii.	Cross-market strengths and network power**  
Google’s dominance in different markets can enforce each other and make google benefits substantially from the network effect. Google build its network among its products, like Android, Google Search and Chrome, and uses this network power to flourish its digital advertising business.

The above findings have shown that Google’s practices have indeed reinforce its market dominance gaining upper hand in abusing others in the market as well as depriving the consumers’ right to choose the preferred product or services. Therefore, changes to the practices and platform will be proposed.
