Google is currently facing anti-trust actions in many different regions. Moving first are the ones in the U.S and Australia, and EU is also following. In this project, we first read the basic background readings, do some research and take the following position for discussion:  
**_Making a case against the current structure and practices, arguing that Google is abusing its monopoly and network power, and proposing a radical change in the platform._**  

This project helps us to gain a thorough understanding of digital marketing, the peculiar network and platform power inherent in this kind of marketing and the structural issues that are causing so many problems to so many businesses.  

The report presents in the following format:  

**1. Brief synopsis of our position and argument**  

**2. Summary of the background**  
- Overview of Google  
- Summary of Google’s Antitrust Cases  

**3. Analysis**  
- Google’s dominance in mobile operating system market  
- 
**4. Proposal**

# <span style="border-bottom:2px solid red;color:red">1. Brief synopsis</span>  

Recently Google has been subjected to multiple antitrust cases in many countries. Google is alleged to be abusing its monopoly and network power. In this report, a case study on Google, focusing on the mobile access segment, has been carried out. Analysis on its practices on mobile operating system, mobile apps, network effect and a few learning from other antitrust cases have revealed the following:  

**i.	Google’s dominance in mobile operating system market**  
Android represents the largest market share of worldwide mobile operating system market. Google abuses its market power and uses various strategies to maintain this dominance, including (1) accessing real-time and vast amount of user data; (2) using contractual restrictions to favor its own applications; (3) acquisition of other tech companies to expand its market share.  

**ii.	Dominance of Android’s default applications**  
Some default applications from Google in Android are also dominate in their markets, especially Google Search and Chrome. Google required Android handset and tablet manufacturers to pre-install the Google Search and Chrome as a condition for allowing them to offer access to its Play app store:  
- As for Google Search, it represents the largest market share in search market and behaves monopolistically, including (1) data and content misappropriation; (2) giving priority to its own products and services; (3) increasing revenue by raising market access prices.  
- As for Chrome, it also occupies the largest market in both mobile and desktop web browser market and behaves monopolistically, including (1) giving priority to Google’s products and services; (2) strengthening Google and hurting its competitors by setting standard unilaterally.  
- Google made payments to large manufacturers and mobile network operators that agreed to exclusively pre-install the Google Search app on their devices.   

**iii.	Cross-market strengths and network power**  
Google’s dominance in different markets can enforce each other and make google benefits substantially from the network effect. Google build its network among its products, like Android, Google Search and Chrome, and uses this network power to flourish its digital advertising business.

The above findings have shown that Google’s practices have indeed reinforce its market dominance gaining upper hand in abusing others in the market as well as depriving the consumers’ right to choose the preferred product or services. Therefore, changes to the practices and platform will be proposed.

## <span style="color:orange"> 2.1 Overview of Google </span>  

Google was created in 1998 as an online search engine. One of the most important innovations in Google is PageRank algorithm which enables Google to improve the quality of its search results despite the rapidly increasing number of websites. It has been the global online search giant for years and ‘googling’ even becomes the alternative word of search.  

While Google has experienced continuous growth and even dominance in search, it has also diversified its services stepping into everywhere in digital industry. In 2000, Google launched its online advertising service AdWords (now called Google Ads) which allows customers to buy advertisement position on Google’s search results page by setting keywords. Google Ads has become one of Google’s core business contributing revenue amounted to 146,92 billion dollars, which represents about 81% of Google’s total revenue(181.69 billion) in 2020 (Joseph Johnson, 2021). Now Google is the largest online search engine as well as digital advertising company. It has leading edge of web browser, mobile operating system, digital maps, email, cloud computing, voice service, etc. It has more than 1 billion customers from various products including Android, Chrome, Gmail, Google Search, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play Store, YouTube, etc. (About Google, 2021). Each of them brings a huge amount of user data to Google, which enforces Google’s market dominant position and facilitate greater profitability through online advertising.  

Google was restructured in 2015, setting Alphabet as the parent company and Google as a wholly owned subsidiary. Alphabet also owns the company's non-search businesses, such as Calico, a biotech company focused on longevity (Wikipedia, 2021) , and Waymo, which is developing self-driving cars (Wikipedia, 2021).  

## <span style="color:orange"> 2.2 Summary of Google’s Antitrust Cases </span>  

Google has been the subject of antitrust investigations and enforcement around the world for years. In September 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice, attorneys general from 50 US states and territories announced that they were launching antitrust investigation into this search and advertising giant. They have also alleged that Google made special deals with mobile device manufacturers to be the default search engine on their devices in order to crowd out competitors (Department of Justice, 2020). In Dec 2020, a group of 10 states accused Google of having in “false, deceptive, or misleading acts” when operating its auction system for Google Ads. And 38 states and territories alleged Google harmed competitors by favoring its own products and services when it displayed search results. (Richard Nieva & Andrew Morse, 2020).  

Antitrust cases did not just happen in recent years. Nearly a decade ago, Google was probed by federal watchdogs for acting against competition — yet Google escaped the inquiry without a case in 2013 (Tony Romm, 2020).  

Across the Atlantic Ocean, the UK's Competition and Market Authority and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission had investigated Google's dominance in digital advertising with a conclusion in July 2020, stating Google has significant market power in digital advertising where it has used its commanding power to charge 30%~40% more than Bing (Competition & Markets Authority, 2020). In 2018, the European Commission had slapped a €4.3 billion fine on Google for abusing its position with Android mobile phone operating systems on mobile devices (European Commission, 2018). Other countries have been contemplating with the move towards Google with various antitrust law.  

Against the backdrop of Google antitrust allegations, we will perform a case study analyzing Google’s dominance and its impact.

# <span style="border-bottom:2px solid green;color:green">3. Analysis</span> 

The use of mobile devices to access websites have been increasing over the years. The mobile device website traffic share has grown from 31% in early year 2015 to around 50% in year 2020 (Statista, 2020). Meanwhile the mobile share of organic search engine increased more than 2 folds from year 2013 to 62% in year 2020 (Statista, 2020).

Another report from Statista (2020) has shown online shopping traffic contribution by mobile devices of more than 50%.

</p>  

It is with this trend in mind that we will approach the case study on Google antitrust by focusing on the mobile segment. We will analyze Google’s dominance in the mobile industry in area of operating system, applications (apps) and mobile channel of digital marking.  

Bala & Srinivasa (2016) has provided a framework showing the mobile industry stack that is comprised of four different functional layers, where each functional layer will be depending on the lower layer. From the lens of mobile users, the browser app used will be depending on the apps installed from distribution platform like Google Play, or App Store. Whether the distribution platform is Google Play or App Store will be depending on the mobile operating system (i.e. Android, iOS), and whether the mobile device like Samsung, Apple, Huawei is adopting Android or iOS as its operating system.

</p> 

Likewise, looking through the mobile industry stack from Google’s viewpoint, Google has required all the mobile device manufacturers that are using Android operating system to have Google Play or other Google key proprietary apps (e.g. Search, Maps, YouTube, and etc) pre-installed, thus giving it advantage in controlling the applications layer (Bala & Srinivasa, 2016).  

Using the "Mobile Industry Slack", we will analyze how Google builds its dominance in the top three layers, its incentives in capturing the mobile access segment, by looking into:
- Mobile operating system  
- Android default applications  
- Cross market strength and network  

In addition, we will also use other antitrust cases or new development in technology field, i.e. fintech, as learning points in arguing our position that Google is abusing its monopoly and network power, and we will then propose for changes based on our analysis.
